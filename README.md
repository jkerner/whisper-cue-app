# WhisperCue

Real-time cueing app for yoga teachers. A calm, glanceable teleprompter for sequences and guided meditations.

## Current Status

**Phase 0 — Complete**
- Home screen, sequence overview, live teach with karaoke-style cueing, practice complete screen

**Phase 1 — Largely Complete**
- [x] Supabase backend (Postgres + Auth)
- [x] 136 poses seeded with authentic TWS 200hr Manual cue language
- [x] Auth screen (email/password + Google OAuth) with auth guard
- [x] Animated home screen with saved sequences list
- [x] Sequence builder — create, edit, reorder sections
- [x] Section editor — add/remove/reorder poses with cues
- [x] Save sequences to Supabase (upsert on edit)
- [x] Vinyasa Flow 60-min pre-filled template
- [x] Share a sequence — public `/s/[token]` view, no auth required
- [x] Universal links configured (`whispercue.app/s/[token]` → app)
- [x] EAS Build + TestFlight (build #9)
- [x] Vercel hosting at `whispercue.app`
- [x] Privacy policy at `whispercue.app/privacy`
- [x] Terms of service at `whispercue.app/terms`
- [x] `support@whispercue.app` email (Microsoft 365)

**Still needed for Phase 1**

- [ ] Apple Sign-In (required for App Store)
- [ ] Phone OTP via Twilio
- [ ] Wire Live Teach to Supabase sequences

## Supabase Data Safety Rules

**Never run a migration script without following these steps:**

1. **Match by exact ID or exact name** — never fuzzy/partial matches. Always print the target row before touching it.
2. **Confirm before executing** — the script must show what will change and wait for a go-ahead before running any PATCH/UPDATE/DELETE.
3. **One row at a time** — never batch-update multiple rows unless explicitly requested for each one.
4. **No irreversible scripts without a backup** — if the operation can't be undone, take a snapshot first.

Violating these rules has permanently destroyed user data before. Don't repeat it.

## Roadmap

- **Phase 0** — MVP: 1 sequence, live teach mode ✓
- **Phase 1** — Launch: Auth, sequence builder, sharing, App Store submission (nearly complete)
- **Phase 2** — Audio: Text-to-speech cues via AirPods, Apple Watch haptics
- **Phase 3** — AI + Community: Post-class ratings, AI improvement suggestions, marketplace
